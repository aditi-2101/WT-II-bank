This project aims at modeling an online bank system. 
The website is complete with the general functionalities of any online bank. We have included separate pages for loans, investments and account information.
As an intelligent component for the website, we have added a recommendation system to suggest various loans and investment opportunities to customers. 
Working: 
The users, on creating an account , can take loans and make investments. For doing this, the user has to set up a meeting with the admins who have access to the admin portal. After verifying the user information in the meeting, they add the user’s loans and investments into the database. 
Payments made by the users to another user or for repaying the loans is verified via OTP which is  sent to the user’s email address to ensure security of the transaction.
Other features include a recommendation system for loans and investments and a  calculator for interests and other calculations.
